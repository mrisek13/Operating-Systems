# Operating-Systems

This repository contains programs related to file management, focusing on explaining the general capabilities of system calls through examples of retrieving data about various parts of the operating system. It demonstrates system calls for working with the file system, retrieving data related to the file system and files themselves, as well as the capabilities of system calls for file management, including reading and writing data.

It introduces the concept of a computer process and thread, showcasing operating system system calls for working with processes and threads, displaying process lists, and providing process data. It explains examples of thread creation and analyzes the differences and similarities between threads and processes.

It provides knowledge and skills related to synchronization mechanisms necessary in conditions of parallel code execution. It covers system calls used to implement synchronization mechanisms such as Monitors, Mutexes, and Semaphores. The usage of synchronization mechanisms is explained on examples including the dining philosophers problem, the producer-consumer problem, and others.

## Usage

Feel free to explore and utilize these programs to deepen your understanding of operating systems concepts, particularly file management, process/thread management, and synchronization mechanisms. Each program is designed to illustrate specific aspects of operating systems functionality through practical examples.
